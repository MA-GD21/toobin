# Sprint 1 Planning Meeting Minutes

## Sprint Setup

You can find the current sprint panning (kanban)-board under [MA-GD21/projects](https://github.com/orgs/MA-GD21/projects). The board consists of four columns:

- Backlog
  Before the sprint planning, the backlog is filled by the team by tasks, that should be considered for the next sprint. We do not collect ALL the tasks for the entire project.
- To Do
  These are the tasks that are open for the current sprint. 
- Doing
  What you are currently working on. Update frequently.
- Done
  Finished tasks ready for reviewing! 


## Issues vs Tasks

In the sprint planning, we are filling the backlog with task notes. 
The respective teams are responsible to create issues with (a manageable granularity) from the task notes and assign responsible team members to them.
Please update your issues frequently and do not hesitate to ask questions (you can add comments) or ask for help. 

## Commit frequency

Please commit your work at least once a day.
