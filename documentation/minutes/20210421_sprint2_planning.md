# Sprint 2 Planning Meeting Minutes

## Project Status
The following tasks have been completed:
- Basic Project Setup
- Graphics Wireframing & Level Editor
- Simple Enemy movement
- Basic Sound Effects

The following tasks are almost completed:
- Character Controller with all movement & accelleration
- Core Game Setup
- Asset placeholders & hi-fi Graphics for segment 1
- Level first segment reproduction

## Timeline & Milestones
- Considering all the other ZHdK activities, specifically from the minor, there is (with the current date) only 6 afternoons left to finalize the project.
- The dates are: 21.04 / 28.04 / 05.05 / (_12.05 Z-Tech_) / 19.05 / _(26.05 Mad Think Tank)_ / 02.06 / 09.06 / _(16.06 Final Week / Presentation / WrapUp)_
- This leaves the team with 3 sprints; which will be roughly the following:
  - MVP         until 04.05
  - Refinment   until 01.06
  - Customize   until 15.06

## Sprint 2 Goals
- On Tuesday, 04. May, we will have a Milestone where we want to playtest the first prototype with the other master students
- Therefore until 03.05 we need a playable prototype and builds that are ready

MVP Game
- Play with the main character and be able to finish the first segment of the first level.
- There are basic animations for players and selected assets. All assets for the first segment are high fidelity.
- The player collides with the level borders
- The following game states are implemented: game start, (death) game reset, play
- Basic enemies with simple moving patterns
- Health meter for player

## Organization
- Keep the tickets organized
- Inform others about your progress
- Be on time (work hours wednesday from 1 PM to 5 PM?)

## Varia

- Does the organization work as is?
- Which team needs extra support?
- Who is responsible for what?

We went through the tickets and the status together. So far the team composition seems to work. If someone has additional resources to help (specifically help the dev team) we should discuss it on a case-to-case basis. For example Roni will take care of implementing the sound engine in the game.
